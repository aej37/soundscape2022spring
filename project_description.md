Project Description 

For my project, I am doing a "Night at the Orchestra". It begins with a woman walking to a Concert Hall outside by a busy street on a rainy evening. She is going out to enjoy an evening at the orchestra. She opens the heavy wooden door and she enters the concert hall. Someone greets her and asks for her ticket. She then goes in to find her seat and there is instruments tuning and small talk as people wait for the concert to start. The conductor walks out on stage and the orchestra starts to play. However this concert takes a turn and the audience will hear a different type of music...welcome to a Night at the Orchestra!
